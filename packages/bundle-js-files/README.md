# Bundle JS Files

Run `yarn webpack` to create a `main.js` file to where webpack will copy the `index.js`.  
Before copying, webpack will do the preprocessing and resolves the import statement.

Currenlty this functionality comes with webpack out of the box, without any configuration.

## How to Run

`yarn start` will use `http-server` to spin up a local webserver.
